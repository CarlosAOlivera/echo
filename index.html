      <h1>About us</h1>
        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          ECHO was founded by a group of young people who are passionate about technology and our planet. <br>
          <br>
          ECHO is a project that aims to combine technology with environmental sustainability. We believe 
          that by using technology in a responsible way, we can reduce our impact on the planet and preserve 
          it for future generations. We also believe that the future must be based on a symbiotic relationship 
          between nature and technology.

      <h1>Current Project</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Our Project is an innovative solution that help improve the environment in areas impacted by human 
          activity. By using the shape of a palm, the project is able to filter air, protect from the rain, and 
          provide light at night.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Succulent plants filter carbon dioxide</li>
          <li>Structure close during rain to form umbrella-like protection</li>
          <li>Lights turn on at nightfall</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>This Ecological Project not only helps to improve the environment, but it also provides a number of 
          benefits to the people who live and work in the area. By filtering air and providing light at night, 
          the project helps to create a healthier and more sustainable living environment.</p>

      <h1>Impact</h1>
      <p>Our project has the potential to make a significant contribution to carbon sequestration efforts! 
        <br><br>
        Sequestering carbon dioxide (CO2) means capturing and storing it in a way that prevents it from being 
        released back into the atmosphere. This can help mitigate the negative impacts of excess CO2 on the 
        environment, including global warming and climate change.
        <br><br>
        Based on our research, our project is able to sequester approximately 1,800,000 ppm (parts per million) 
        of CO2 per square meter per year in the short term. This is a very impressive amount of carbon 
        sequestration, and it could make a significant impact on the environment on a larger scale.
        <br><br>
        It's important to note that carbon sequestration is just one aspect of addressing climate change and 
        reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Other measures, such as reducing energy consumption, switching to 
        clean energy sources, and adopting sustainable practices, are also important in the effort to combat 
        climate change.
